        <p>
        The <a href="/Articles/532593/">user namespaces</a> feature is conceptually
fairly straightforward—allow users to run as root in their own space, while
limiting their privileges on the system outside that space—but the
implementation has, perhaps 
unsurprisingly, proven 
to be quite tricky.  There are some assumptions about user IDs and how
they operate that
are deeply wired into the kernel in various subsystems; shaking those out
has taken some time, which led to some hesitation about enabling the
feature in distribution kernels.  But that reluctance has largely passed at
this point, which makes the recent discovery
of a root-privilege escalation using user namespaces and the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/overlayfs.txt">overlay
filesystem</a> (overlayfs) that much more dangerous.

        The kernel development community is organized as a hierarchy, with
developers submitting patches to maintainers who will, in turn, commit
those patches 
to a repository and push them upstream to higher-level maintainers.  This
hierarchy logically looks a lot like the directory hierarchy of the kernel
source itself; most maintainers look after one or more subtrees of the
kernel source tree.  But does that model really describe how patches make
it into the mainline?  The kernel's git repository, with the aid of some
scripting, holds an answer to that question.

that the Bitcoin experiment has failed</a>.  "<span>In a company, someone
who did not share the goals of the organisation would be dealt with in a
simple way: by firing him.  But Bitcoin Core is an open source project, not
a company. Once the 5 developers with commit access to the code had been
chosen and Gavin [Andresen] had decided he did not want to be the leader,
there was no procedure in place to ever remove one. And there was no
interview or screening process to ensure they actually agreed with the
project’s goals.</span>"  If Bitcoin is indeed failing as the article says,
it's failing due to project governance issues rather than technical or
regulatory problems.

        Anybody who has been paying attention to the net over the last week or so will
certainly have noticed an abundance of articles with titles like "<a

to hack any Linux machine just using backspace</a>".  All this press does
indeed highlight an important vulnerability, but it may not be the one that
they think they are talking about.

"<span>The scholarship program will begin with The Goodwill Excel Center and the Goodwill Career and Technical Academy in Central Texas and is expected to expand to other communities in the future. The Goodwill Excel Center is the first free public charter high school for adults in Texas. Students age 17-50 have the opportunity to earn their high school diploma, complete an in-demand professional certification and begin post-secondary education.

The Extended Learning Linux Foundation Scholarship Program created by Linux Foundation and Goodwill includes free access to the Intro to Linux (<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-linux-linuxfoundationx-lfs101x-2">LFS101x</a>) and Essentials of System Administration (<a href="https://training.linuxfoundation.org/linux-courses/system-administration-training/essentials-of-system-administration">LFS201</a>) courses, and the Linux Foundation Certified System Administrator exam at no cost.

        The <a href="https://www.linuxplumbersconf.org/2016/">2016 Linux Plumbers Conference</a> (LPC) has <a href="https://www.linuxplumbersconf.org/2016/call-for-microconferences/">announced</a> its <a href="http://www.linuxplumbersconf.org/2016/participate/#cfmc">Call for Microconferences</a>.  LPC will be held in Santa Fe, NM, USA on November&nbsp;2-4, co-located with the Kernel Summit. "<span>A microconference is a collection of collaborative sessions focused on problems in a particular area of the Linux plumbing, which includes the kernel, libraries, utilities, UI, and so forth, but can also focus on cross-cutting concerns such as security, scaling, energy efficiency, or a particular use case. Good microconferences result in solutions to these problems and concerns, while the best microconferences result in patches that implement those solutions.</span>"

Back in early 2013, your editor <a href="/Articles/540138/">dedicated a
sacrificial handset</a> to the testing of the then-new Ubuntu Touch
distribution.  At that time, things were so unbaked that the distribution
came with mocked-up data for unready apps; it even came with a set of fake
tweets.  Nearly three years later, it seemed time to give Ubuntu Touch
another try on another sacrificial device.  This distribution has certainly
made some progress in those years, but, sadly, it still seems far from being
a competitive offering in this space.

The <a
href="http://aferrero2707.github.io/PhotoFlow/">PhotoFlow</a> image
editor is a relative newcomer to the field of free-software
photography tools.  The project was started in 2014, and some people
might consider it an odd choice of undertaking&mdash;given that there
are, these days, quite a few capable raw-photo editors to choose
from.  But PhotoFlow does bring something new to the table.

        Theo de Raadt suggests that a significant OpenSSH security issue is about
to be exposed; the message reads, in full: "<span>Important SSH patch coming
soon.  For now, every on all operating systems, please do the following:
Add undocumented 'UseRoaming no' to ssh_config or use '-oUseRoaming=no'
to prevent upcoming #openssh client bug CVE-2016-0777. More later.</span>"
<p>
<b>Update</b>: that important patch appears to be <a
href="/Articles/671874/">OpenSSH 7.1p2</a>, available now.  "<span>The OpenSSH client code between 5.4 and 7.1
   contains experimential support for resuming SSH-connections (roaming).

   The matching server code has never been shipped, but the client
   code was enabled by default and could be tricked by a malicious
   server into leaking client memory to the server, including private
   client user keys.</span>"  There are a few other security fixes there as
   well.
<p>
<b>Update 2</b>: see <a
   href="https://www.qualys.com/2016/01/14/cve-2016-0777-cve-2016-0778/openssh-cve-2016-0777-cve-2016-0778.txt">the
   Qualys advisory</a> for vast amounts of detail.

        The Qt Company has announced changes to the open source licensing and
product structure of the Qt cross-platform application development
framework.  "<span>New versions of Qt will be licensed under a commercial license, GPLv2, GPLv3, and LGPLv3, but no longer under LGPLv2.1. The updated open source licenses better ensure end user freedom when using open source licensed versions of Qt. LGPLv3 explicitly forbids the distribution of closed embedded devices. Distributing software under these terms includes a patent grant to all receivers of the software. Commercial Qt licensing removes these requirements and includes professional technical support from The Qt Company.</span>"
