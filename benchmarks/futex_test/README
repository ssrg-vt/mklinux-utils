STEPS:
1) make clean
2) make

3) a) To check mutex	            : ./mut <threads> <rounds> <cpu>
   b) To check bar 		    : ./bar <threads> <rounds> <cpu>
   c) To check condition wait/signal: ./cond <threads> <rounds> <cpu>

4) If you want to run test script, copy bar cond mut executables to bin
and execute glibc.sh [See usage in the file]

Note:
This is a initial version of glibc test suite.
Need to automate by scrpits.
